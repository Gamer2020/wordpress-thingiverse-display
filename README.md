# wordpress-thingiverse-display
A wordpress plugin to display a Thingiverse thing in a wordpress post. Uses the Thingiverse API.

I will make this available in wordpress eventually.

Installation
========

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use Settings->Thingiverse Display screen to configure the plugin. You will need a Thingiverse API key.
4. Add the short codes that you wish to use to your desired pages.
